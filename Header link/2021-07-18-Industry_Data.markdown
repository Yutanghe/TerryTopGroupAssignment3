When looking at the data supplied by burning glass it can be seen that Generalised skills such as communication and teamwork are of high demand and are an integral part of being a Information systems security engineer. With specialised skills required This data tells me that the demand for my apiring position is high and as a result of this I would not change my aspirations of becoming a Information systems security engineer.

Some of the more in-demand IT-specific skills to become a Full Stack Developer are SQL, JavaScript, and use of Git. Top generic skills for Full Stack Developers include communication skills, teamwork and collaboration, troubleshooting, and requires organisational skills. The highest ranked IT skills not in the required skill set are: SAP, business management, business analysis. The highest ranked general skills not in the required skill set are: writing, planning, and research. Looking at the job data, it seems front end developers have more job availability than full stack developers. I think I could shift my focus to primarily learning front end development and languages due to the greater demand of front end developers.

The skill Set of software engineering manager ranges from the some of the most demanding skill set like communication and team working skill
while at the same time also require some of the least demanding skill sets like management decision making.
Some demanding skills that are not required in my roles are problem solving, organising and writing.
My job is that it has some highly transferable skill sets making it very versatile in terms of how well the skill set can transfer to other jobs.
After looking at burning glass data my opinion on my ideal job has not changed.

<b>Cayden:</b>

The Burning glass data suggests that a software engineer is the seventh least sought after job in 2018 at around a third of the most, the skills required however (communication problem solving and teamwork) skills that are highly regarded soft skills are required for being an effective software developer. The highest skill in demand (SQL Javascript and JAVA) are also commonly used by software developers so the position will be very versatile and able to thrive in other roles.

<b>Anh:</b>
 
According to a report from burning glass, cybersecurity professionals also need communication and teamwork skills as well as some specialized skills that require high qualifications. And from the information about demanding professional qualifications and mandatory soft skills, the demand for recruitment for this industry is still on the rise in the future. Therefore, I do not intend to change my choice to become a cybersecurity.
