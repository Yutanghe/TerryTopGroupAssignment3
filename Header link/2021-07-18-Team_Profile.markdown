# Kim:
My name is Kim Fyfe (S3916921), I am Filipino/Australian and live in Geelong. I studied Bachelor of Nursing/Psychological Science before changing course to study towards a Bachelor of IT. I like movies, tv shows, the internet, and hanging out with friends. Having grown up using the internet, I took an interest in internet technologies and learned some web design in high school. Due to my previous studies, I am interested in how technology can improve medical and healthcare services.
The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator identifies me as a Logician/INTP-T, the Big Five Personality Traits highlight Openness to Experience and Agreeableness, and the Learning Style indicates that I am a tactile learner with some visual learning. The test results tell me that I am analytical, cooperative, sincere, open-minded, but I am an introverted and reserved person, with a tendency to overthink things and focus on logic rather than my own or other peoples’ feelings. In a group setting, I would most likely be sincere and try to complete tasks as efficiently as possible, would be open to ideas and cooperation, but I would not be very assertive and might be too self-conscious about my own work.

# Aidan:
My name is Aidan Suski (S3843894) I am a student at Rmit university, my nationalities include Australian / German / Italian, and my spoken language is english. Hobbies I tend to enjoy are working on my cars at home, metal work and fabrication, woodworking and from time to time I build new computers. My interest in I.T is based on computers and networking. I enjoy constructing custom Personal Computers and building new cases using 3d modelling and printing. I find repurposing computer parts to construct smaller projects as interesting and a good learning experience. Networks in I.T have been a part of my younger ages where I set up networks throughout my home and built databases throughout college. These were simplistic databases and networks, but they worked. This pursuit landed me into robotics and programming Arduinos. In my senior years I took an interest in robotics and built a 3d printed robotic arm with fully functioning fingers. Stemming from simple Lego robotics to developing 3d modelling skills and ability to use 3d printers. These test results aided me in understanding what areas I need to improve in, allowing me to gain skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership and teamwork, which are a necessity in the field of cyber security.  The personality test showed that I have a protagonist personality. In the creativity test I conducted I received a 59/80 result which led me to believe that creativity is one of my key strengths. In a learning Style test I found that I was a highly visual focused learner scoring; Auditory: 25% Visual: 40% Tactile: 35%. These results may influence me to be more outgoing, share more ideas and take on feedback. May influence me to take more leadership positions within a group format.

# Cayden:
My name is Cayden Burling (s3917982) and I am currently a member of the IT team ‘Terrytops Nerds’, I’ve always been interested in technology and have some experience through years 10-11 in highschool where I learned many of the basics of IT in Multimedia class like the different components of computers and many basic skills (web development animation etc). My interests and hobbies mainly include playing tennis, solving handheld puzzles (like rubiks cubes) and playing video games. According to 16 personalities my personality type is a Virtuoso (ISTP-A) and I’m a visual learner. After doing this IQ test (https://iqtest.com/) I’ve found that my IQ is apparently 133, this however should not be considered accurate however because the test only had true and false answers.

# Tony:
My name is Tony He (s3914127), My nationality is Australian/ Chinese, I like playing badminton and manga or anime. I think IT has boundless possibilities. when I start doing IT, I would sometimes get intensively immersed. I would improve my codes, until I am satisfied. Then the next day, I would find so many ways to improve codes. Sometimes my mind would continue thinking about codes in my sleep. But whether it was good or bad depends on how you look at it. My ‘16 personalities’ test results show that my personality is assertive mediator. My learning style test result shows that I am a tactile learner. My ‘DISC’ test result shows that I am a steadiness type. I accepted who I am, and working around my weakness is the way to go instead of being what I am not. I think those results tempt me to do things out of my comfort zone. The results suggest me to do the supportive role for the team.

# Anh:
My name is Anh Pham (s3804723). I am Vietnamese and now I am living in Ho Chi Minh City. I registered to learn a Bachelor of IT. I am not good at communication and behavior, but I can chat freely with acquaintances, and also hang out with them. My favourites are reading novels, anime and manga or sometimes swimming. Currently I try to join courses in yoga, gym or make crafts. The reason I am interested in IT is that data and information are leaked every time I use the web to read or surf social media, it gives me no sense of security and privacy. So I want to learn more about it.
