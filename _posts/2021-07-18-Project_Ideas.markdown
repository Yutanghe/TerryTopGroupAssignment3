# Overview

Our project idea is a mobile app that notifies the healthcare provider user when medications of their allocated patients are due to be given. Major features would include timed and delayed reminders, editable notifications, and link to an online drug directory for medications listed. It would primarily be used by new or inexperienced nurses to help improve time management and reduce rates of missed medication. Technology and skills used would be mobile app creation software, understanding of programming language, and smartphone devices. Project success would depend on whether rates of missed medication in facilities that implement the app are reduced or not.


# Motivation

An issue in the healthcare industry is medication error resulting in adverse patient outcomes. Some reasons for medication errors can include written or verbal miscommunication between staff, staffing and time mismanagement (Hammoudi, Ismaile and Abu Yahya, 2017). Technology use may help to reduce these medication errors. Certain hospitals, aged care and community facilities with limited funding and resources may benefit from a cheaper and readily available alternative solution to bedside computer terminals in the form of a smartphone app. The app would be used to help with time management and planning in regards to medication dispensing and care, with the primary intention of reducing missed medications. Although there are apps available that remind the user of medications that they themselves need to take, there are currently no apps that help remind the healthcare provider to dispense medications, so it may be a good idea to create the app.


# Description

<b>Purpose:</b>

The mobile app would be used by healthcare providers such as Nurses and Doctors who are responsible for dispensing patient medications and treatments. The intention of the project is a time management app and learning resource, especially for student nurses, grad nurses, and new nurses overall, who are learning to take on complex and lengthy medication rounds and manage tasks more efficiently.

<b>App Features:</b>

The primary purpose of the app would be to notify the user of their allocated patients’ medications due to be given, with a notification on the phone or device somewhat like an alarm or timer. The app would only be used as a reminder and educational resource and not to be used as a replacement of official medication charts. Because the app is used on the personal smartphones of healthcare providers, it would feature a list of allocated patients by room or patient number, and exclude sensitive personal details for privacy reasons. App notifications can be opened to show the list of medications highlighted that need to be given in that period of time, with completed medications greyed out. Upcoming medications should be able to be checked off such as when patients prefer earlier medications or taken at meal times, or for the user to get ahead of busy medication rounds. Reminder notifications and alarms would be used for medications still needing to be given, in intervals of time that can be set akin to a snooze alarm, until the user ticks them off and is therefore considered complete. Otherwise, medications that need to be delayed such as when the user is attending an education conference or the patient is not currently on the ward should be able to have reminder timer functions for example “remind me again in one hour”. Dispensed medications can be checked off to help keep the user up to date on completed tasks, and clears the checklist once all the medications of the shift are completed. Medications that have been missed will remain on the checklist until completed or reason given in an extra memo such as patient refusal or prescription changes. The app would have personalisation of timers such as early reminders of upcoming extensive medication rounds, or medications that require double checks such as drugs of dependence, intravenous therapies, etc. that may need more preparation and planning beforehand to administer safely. There may also be reminders for extra procedures such as taking blood sugar readings for patients with diabetes. The lists of medications due can be amended manually if prescribers change medications or add to a medication list. Individual medication information may be hyperlinked to an online drug directory for dosage and indications that can open in the device’s default web browser.

<b>Database:</b>

The app could use a central management system to record doctors’ prescriptions and would distribute patient allocations for nurses who are rostered on. In an emergency situation where a nurse has to leave the ward, there could be a feature to send the patient medication round to another nurse or nurses to supplement their work. A mobile app database to store information can be used such as Back4App.

<b>Summary:</b>

In summary, the main features of the mobile app would need to include a database of patient medication times, timed and modifiable notifications with snooze alarm type functions, delayed timer functions, checklist features that can include optional personal memos, and also hyperlinks that redirect to a browser to search for medications in an online drug directory.


# Tools and Technologies

An app creation tool such as the MIT App Inventor could be used to create the mobile application. Whichever app creation tool we use must be capable of including the major features mentioned in the design description and concept. When creating the app, it would need to be compatible with Apple and/or Android smartphone devices so testing would need to be completed on those devices. Testing app functions should be done on new versions of Apple or Android operating systems for compatibility and optimal functioning, so it is recommended to test with newer generation smartphones if available in the group.


# Skills Required

Ideally, understanding of common mobile app programming languages such as Kotlin, JavaScript, or Java would be beneficial for coding. Various online resources such as step by step videos and tutorial websites could be used to brush up on knowledge required for programming the app. However, it may not be feasible to program an entire mobile app from scratch especially due to the beginning stages of IT studies and varying levels of programming experience of the group, so it might be necessary to use app creating software with simple programming elements. Apple or Android smartphones would be used to finetune, bug test, and troubleshoot while creating the app.


# Outcome

The intention of the project is to help with time management of medication administration and prevent missed medications through reminders and checklist functions, primarily for use by new and inexperienced nurses. The project would be successful if it was able to reduce the rates of missed medication instances while being used at a healthcare facility in a period of time. The success of this project would see the reduction of medication errors and subsequent adverse effects on patients, potentially reducing length of hospital stay, and decreasing cost and resources of keeping patients for extensive periods of time due to such errors.
