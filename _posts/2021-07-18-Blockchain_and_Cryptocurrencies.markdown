# How do blockchain and cryptocurrencies actually work?


<b>Blockchain:</b>

Blockchain is a type of digital storage created using pockets of data called ‘Blocks’ and chaining them together in chronological order, these blocks of data are all given unique identifiers in the form of cryptographic hash codes (256-bit numbers) and then attached to a node (a piece of technology that maintains a copy of the blockchain). Since the blocks are chained together in chronological order going back to change some previously stored data requires you to also change every block after, each block depends on the sequential blocks node to confirm their content is accurate and matches with the nodes copy of the blockchain, this makes the contents of blocks relatively permanent as finding each hash code for the block you want to replace and every block after requires a massive amount of computing power and time as hashes are irreversible and can only be found through brute force.



New blocks are added to the chain through a process called ‘mining’ where miners use software that solves the complex and demanding problem that is finding the nonce (lowest number that links to the next hash code) for the blocks to be introduced to the chain. Since every block has its own unique nonce/hashcode it isn’t easy to mine new blocks and much harder for them to be added when the chains are larger. When a block is successfully mined and verified by the system the change is then accepted by the nodes on the blockchain network and the miner is rewarded financially



Blockchains can either be private (controlled by one person or company) or public (allows anyone to add new blocks and majority rules), Private blockchains are used by companies to track and transfer data or sensitive material and is very useful to companies that sell valuable products or food so that the process of where they come from is completely transparent as every step is recorded and stored within a block. Public blockchains are decentralised which allows for transactions and transfer of data with no restrictions on location and no third party or mediator, This makes it exceptional for virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies) like bitcoin being the largest cryptocurrency in the market as of today.

<b>Cryptocurrencies:</b>

Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies that are created and distributed with blockchain technology, there are over 4500 different types of cryptocurrencies as the code for blockchain is open source anyone with enough knowledge can even make their own currency. Cryptocurrencies are able to be traded for real money and goods and services that support them without interference form banks, this allows for little to no transaction fees but since blockchains are almost impossible to change makes them non-refundable. The future of cryptocurrencies is hard to determine since they are relatively new as bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency) was made in january 2009 and the technology of blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape has yet to mature many countries and companies however are starting to adopt cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and it slowly becomes more widely used it may even be the currency of the future.

# Likely impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream in the future would drastically change the way banks operate and the developers of cryptocurrencies and blockchain will face the same challenges and responsibilities as banks currently do now when it comes to supporting their customers.

predictions for the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies

New governance models that standardise the information from different blockchains and cryptocurrencies as well as allowing multiple blockchains to interact with each other to improve the connectivity of different blockchains and their currencies.

This improved interconnectivity between blockchains will allow them to work together and will be essential for the future if we want to integrate blockchain for wider use.

Combining blockchain with other technologies will allow new technologies to be born and will help us to create better algorithms for more secure and accessible data long term.

Mechanisms will emerge that will improve our trust with blockchain technology and remove the need for human interaction as humans are more likely to make mistakes and commit fraud.

And finally with more countries adopting blockchain technologies it will redefine how the world makes payments and eventually we will be able to digitize other types of real world assets and securities.

# How will this affect you?

The future of blockchain and other crypto technologies and the effect on our society probably won't impact us as much as one might first think, much like how as a society we slowly changed the way we spend our money and send information to one another, over time this  has become more technologically advanced but it fundamentally hasn't changed like how sending letters with paper has slowly converted into sending emails and texts over your phone.
