# What does it do?  


Recent years, the need for human intervention has reduced with respect to a variety of tasks in the automotive domain, this is driven by the increasing development in the vehicle’s autonomy domain, Modern technologies, markets, and software play a crucial role at the enabler of fully autonomous vehicles. Evidence indicates that technological improvements have made vehicle autonomy more feasible (Magliozzi 2019a). The market has contributed to making autonomous vehicles attractive. Companies such as Google and Tesla have been heavily advertising autonomous software and, simultaneously, 33 companies are working on the development of autonomous vehicles by 2021. It is safe to say that the market has helped make the autonomy of vehicles attractive (Magliozzi 2019b). As of today, semi-autonomous vehicles can identify road lanes, detecting pedestrians, and avoiding collisions, further reinforcing the anticipated future where all AI will acquire human capabilities and surpass humans (Magliozzi 2019c). Due to the dramatic growth of software associated with vehicles, development cycles have shifted away from rigid V-models to more dynamic, flexible agile methods based on frequent iterations, allowing for faster feedback. (V-models are organized in a V-shape, starting with high-level requirements, followed by implementation, and finally, verification of integrated components (Magliozzi 2019d). However, the most innovative scene is the software industry. This is due to 'update over air'. The idea behind "update over air" is that a car's software can be updated just as easily as a phone (Magliozzi 2019e). The goal of artificial intelligence is to enable machines to operate autonomously in every situation, using any task, at any time. The artificial intelligence will drive us towards making optimal choices in recognition and decision-making. Nevertheless, fully autonomous vehicles require a variety of machine learning methods to be applied to several of their components (Magliozzi 2019f). In some companies, autonomous trucks are being developed so that they can operate without human interference. Volvo AB, Daimler, Scania, Iveco, Komatsu, and Caterpillar are among them (Magliozzi 2019g). Self-driving cars are assumed to operate in diverse environments. They will need to make decisions in unpredictable, uncontrollable, and uncertain circumstances (Magliozzi 2019h). For autonomous vehicles to be deployed, it is fundamentally important to solve three inherent problems: connectivity with the outside world, adaptability to changing environments, and open communication with other autonomous vehicles. Machine learning can be applied to all three of these problems through perception, prediction, and planning (Magliozzi 2019i). An interesting solution to this problem is the use of self-adaptive systems, i.e., systems that can adapt their behavior at runtime without human intervention in response to changes in their environment or internal states (Magliozzi 2019j). In the future, cars will not be monolithic, but will be connected systems; a problem with one system can affect other systems. To harness this knowledge, cars will need to evolve, drawing on knowledge from other vehicles (Magliozzi 2019k).


# What is the impact?


As we move forward, automation will play a significant part in planning, developing, and changing cities. We are on the verge of a major paradigm shift in the way we think about mobility, how we build cities, and how we live and work in connected society with autonomous vehicles (Hörl 2016). So far, autonomous vehicles have substantially altered the way we think about traffic. Autonomous vehicles will not only revolutionize transportation, but also dramatically alter urban form if all these assumptions hold true (Shanker et al., 2013) “(Hörl 2016). They may induce substantial amounts of additional travel demand and fuel a new wave of suburbanization and urban sprawl by sub-sustainably reducing generalized travel costs (Mayer 2017).  

Accordingly, mobility is expected to improve as capacity either increases, leading to a more fluid traffic flow, or decreases, resulting in traffic congestion and slower travel speeds (Hörl 2016). Since autonomous vehicles do not have a driver, they are also accessible to people who are unable or not permitted to drive today (Mayer 2017). Aged, children, and adults without a driver's license are included in this study because they make up the largest group of additional users. By using shared autonomous vehicles, individuals can affordably access the comfort and individual experience of a private car without dealing with the hassles and financial burdens associated with owning one (Mayer 2017).   

The future of autonomous vehicles is expected to bring substantial improvements in accessibility. However, the magnitude of the disruptions this will cause is strongly dependent on the actual gains autonomous vehicles can achieve (Mayer 2017). During a ride, they provide passengers with the option to perform non-driving activities, making shared autonomous vehicles highly competitive, if not superior, to conventional car ownership and public transportation today. Such changes can thus be expected to cause a significant modal shift (Mayer 2017).


# How will this affect you?


Furthermore, unlike airplanes, we cannot presume that in cars there will be professional drivers, and there may even be drivers with degraded performance in the future as a result of automation (Magliozzi 2019). Those individuals older than 65 years recognized that as they were aging such vehicles would be useful.

  “By the time they allow it on the road, it will be safer than my driving.” “As I get older, I would find this technology more and more appealing” “Easier as I get older. I get distracted and my reflexes are not as good as they used to be.” Even a couple of the persons ages 46-65 pointed out the benefits as they age. “Becoming disabled soon, I will not be able to drive myself.” “Also entering my older years, it will benefit me.” (As cited by Zmud 2017).  


Adapting to automated vehicles will alter the mode choice and built environment of people in the developed world, resulting in a reduction of walking and an increase in sitting. However, the impact on demand for public transportation and parking is ambiguous (Spence 2020).  


  “I could do something productive on my trip.” “We waste a lot of time behind the wheel. To be able to be productive like on a plane or rail.” “It would let me do other tasks, such as eating, watch a movie, be on cell phone while you are on your trip.” “It would be easier to conduct business or for personal time.” “I spend a lot of time driving; it would be nice to be able to do other things.” “My commute is short, but it would allow me to do other things.” “Reduce stress of living in big city. Get in vehicle and work on other things. Make it a more productive trip.” (As cited by Zmud 2017).
