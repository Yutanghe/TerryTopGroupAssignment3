<q>An issue in the healthcare industry is medication error resulting in adverse patient outcomes. Some reasons for medication errors can include written or verbal miscommunication between staff, staffing and time mismanagement (Hammoudi, Ismaile and Abu Yahya, 2017).</q>
<br>Technology use may help to reduce these medication errors. Certain hospitals, aged care and community facilities with limited funding and resources may benefit from a cheaper and readily available alternative solution to bedside computer terminals in the form of a smartphone app. The app would be used to help with time management and planning in regards to medication dispensing and care, with the primary intention of reducing missed medications. Although there are apps available that remind the user of medications that they themselves need to take, there are currently no apps that help remind the healthcare provider to dispense medications, so it may be a good idea to create the app.
