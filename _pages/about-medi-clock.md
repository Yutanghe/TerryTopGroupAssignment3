<h1>Context</h1>
Although there are apps available that remind the user of medications that they themselves need to take, there are currently no apps that help remind the healthcare provider to dispense medications and other tasks, so these features may be good to focus on for the planning and creation of the app. The project is intended to be an educational resource and be used to help keep track of tasks for newer and less experienced healthcare providers such as student nurses and grad nurses, rather than just an app reminder to take medication, which is already available. Certain healthcare facilities have computerised systems to track medications and patient details, however for smaller facilities with perhaps lower funding or resources this is not possible. The app would primarily be used in such places where healthcare workers phones can be used in a beneficial way for accurate patient care and treatment.

<h1>Our Goal</h1>
The mobile app would be used by healthcare providers such as Nurses and Doctors who are responsible for dispensing patient medications and treatments. The intention of the project is a time management app and learning resource, especially for student nurses, grad nurses, and new nurses overall, who are learning to take on complex and lengthy medication rounds and manage tasks more efficiently.
We will need to create the mobile app. This includes designing and implementing the interface, learning and programming the functions of the app such as how to create alarm and timer functions, and research such as medication information. The app needs to have a simple design for ease of use, but is able to include or add more app functions for future development.
